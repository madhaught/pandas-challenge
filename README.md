# pandas-challenge

This repository is for the Module 4 (learning pandas) challenge for the CWRU Data Visualization Bootcamp.

In this repository is a folder called PyCitySchools with the code that I wrote for this challenge (named "PyCitySchoolsCodeMH.ipynb"), the starter code named "PyCitySchools_starter.ipynbb" that was provided (which my code is modeled on), and a resources folder with the two csv files that were analyzed in this challenge.

In addition to basing my code on the starter code provided and the lessons we learned in class, I worked on this assignment with the help of the data visualization tutor Jamie Miller.
